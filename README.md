# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
The project was part of Udacity's Machine Learning Cross-Skilling Nanodegree. The goal was to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners, including SVMs, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
